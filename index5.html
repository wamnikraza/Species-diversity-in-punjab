        Biodiversity, short for biological diversity, refers to the variety and variability of life forms on Earth.It encompasses all the different
        species of plants, animals, microorganisms, and the ecosystems they inhabit. Biodiversity is a fundamental component ofthe natural 
        world and plays a vital role in maintaining the health and stability of ecosystems. It includes three main levels of diversity: <br>
        1. Genetic Diversity: This level of biodiversity focuses on the variety of genes within a species. Genetic diversity is essential for
           the adaptation and survival of species, as it allows them to evolve and respond to changing environmental conditions.
           Higher genetic  diversity can lead to healthier and more resilient populations 
        2. Species Diversity: Species diversity refers to the number and variety of different species in a particular habitat or ecosystem. 
           It is a measure of the richness and evenness of species present in an area. High species diversity is often indicative of a healthy
           and well-balanced ecosystem.
        3.  Ecosystem Diversity: Ecosystem diversity relates to the variety of different habitats, ecosystems, and ecological processes in a 
            given region. It includes the different interactions and relationships between species, as well as the physical and environmental
            factors that influence them.

        Punjab is a one of smallest state located in the northern part of India contributing about 1.5% area of country and is a part of 
        Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains formed due to the sediments deposits of rivers and its tributaries. Punjab can be divided into 3
        physiographic regions, namely; Sub-mountainous Himalayas- Shivalik Hills, Central & Eastern Alluvial plains and Western Semi-arid 
        Area. The climate of the State is tropical, semi-arid, hot and subtropical monsoon type with cold winter and hot summer. Despite its 
        small size, Punjab has an extraordinary amount of diversity in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. <br>
        Key Facets of Biodiversity in Punjab
          •	    Predominantly cropland ecosystem with 84 % area under agriculture
          •	    5.93% of Total Geographic Area under Forest Cover (3.67 %) and Tree Cover (2.26 %) (ISFR – 2023)
          •	    Large number of flora and fauna recorded from forests area, agricultural areas & wetlands
          •	    4 Biodiversity Rich Gardens
          •     Many Sacred Groves & Biodiversity Rich Sites outside the Protected Area Network
